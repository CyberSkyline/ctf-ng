## Installation

Make sure to complete the initial setup for CTFd on the webportal

## Development

### Running the server
`npm start`

Use `CTRL + C` to stop the server. 

### Backend Development
After making any changes to the backend, you need to run `npm reload` to restart CTFd with your changes.

### Frontend Development
Vite provides hot module reloading. Most changes will be reflected on the page in real-time. If not, you can refresh the page. 

You do not need to run any commands after making frontend changes. 

This is a single-page app. To reach the vite entrypoint, go to `/hello`.
